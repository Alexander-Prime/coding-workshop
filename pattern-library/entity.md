# Entities

Entities are simple objects that model the things in our domain that have some thread of identity. For the purpose of our workshop, the Purchase Order is the most obvious example of an entity. These objects should be "kept spare" and limited to only attributes and behavior that are essential to the concept. We should be looking to remove behavior and attributes out to other objects.
